## Reporting a Vulnerability

The GitHub Repository Analyzer team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@rmdash.fr](mailto:security@rmdash.fr). If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key (available upon request).

Please include the following information in your report:

1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Potential impact of the vulnerability
4. Any potential solutions you've identified
5. Your name/handle (if you wish to be credited)

### What to Expect

After you have submitted a vulnerability report, you can expect:

- A confirmation of receipt within 48 hours
- An initial assessment of the report within 7 days
- Regular updates on our progress (at least every 7 days)
- A public acknowledgment of your report (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Response Process

Our security response process is:

1. Reporter submits vulnerability via email
2. We confirm receipt and begin investigation
3. We determine severity and impact
4. We develop and test a fix
5. We release a security update and disclose the vulnerability
6. We publicly acknowledge the reporter's contribution (with permission)

### Security Update Policy

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed. We aim to release patches for critical vulnerabilities within 7 days of confirmation.

Updates will be published:

- As new releases on GitHub and npm
- With security advisories in the GitHub repository
- In our release notes and CHANGELOG
