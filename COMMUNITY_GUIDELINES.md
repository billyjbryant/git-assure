# Community Guidelines

The GitHub Repository Analyzer project is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive experience for everyone. These community guidelines outline our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Being respectful and inclusive**: Value each other's ideas, styles, and viewpoints
- **Being collaborative**: Work together effectively, help each other, and have fun
- **Being considerate**: Think about how your actions affect others
- **Being patient and welcoming**: Especially with those who may not understand things from your perspective
- **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback**
- **Assuming good intentions**: Approach situations positively when misunderstandings arise

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Harassment**: Offensive comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- **Discrimination**: Discrimination based on age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation
- **Unwelcome sexual attention or advances**
- **Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks**
- **Public or private harassment**
- **Publishing others' private information without explicit permission**
- **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting**

## Responsibilities of Project Maintainers

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with these guidelines, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

These guidelines apply both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [contact@rmdash.fr](mailto:contact@rmdash.fr) (replace with your actual contact email). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Enforcement process:

1. **Warning**: Private, written notice from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.
2. **Temporary Ban**: Temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.
3. **Permanent Ban**: Permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Attribution

These guidelines are adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0, available at <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/>.

## Questions

If you have questions about these guidelines or need clarification about any points, please reach out to the maintainers. We are committed to providing a welcoming environment and will work with community members to address any concerns.
